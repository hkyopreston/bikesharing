# NYC Citi Bike Analysis and Gender Distribution

In this project, I am analyzing the population and gender diversity of both Des Moines, Iowa and New York City. My key questions for research were: 

    - What is the population of Des Moines?
    - How does its population compare to the population of New York City?
    - Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
    -What is the gender diversity of Des Moines?
    How does it compare to teh gender diversity of New York City?
    What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?

The first part of my research was to dive into historical Citi Bike Data for New York City. This data gave a baseline as to what investors should be looking for in regards to population density and gender diversity.

## Story Page Summaries
The first story page shows a dashboard of NYC Citi Bike Visualations. The dashboard start by showing how many total records the data is analyzing. It includes a graph of the Average Trip Duration by Age. This graph depics a trend where the younger the rider, the longer the trip duration. We can also see that Citi Bike Users are heavily congregated in Manhattan, which is more densily populated and draws in more tourism. 
Although the population nor population density in Des Moines is as high as New York City, there is no reason to worry about utilization. The largest age group in both Des Moines and NYC is Male and Females age 25-29. This makes up a large bike commuter population. This is also the group that is most likely to have longer bike trips and more frequent rides. It is promising that both cities share the same age and gender demographics. 

Also, according to the [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/05/younger-workers-in-cities-more-likely-to-bike-to-work.html), "younger workers in cities commute by bicycle at relatively high percentages, with 1.5% of 16 to 24-year-olds in principal cities of metros biking to work." As Des Moines has a larger demographic of young workers, there is a demand for a Citi Bike program. 

The next story is a bubble graph of bike utilization. The larger and darker the bubbles are, the more a bike has been utilized. This is a good indication of when bikes will need to be serviced. Since servicing bikes will be the main cost after implementation, it's important to see how many rides each bike gets. 

The peak hours bar graph shows that bike rides are most popular duing the hours of 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm. This graph is important because it shows that bike rides fall in line with employee commute hours. According to [GeoStat.org](https://www.geostat.org/data/des-moines-ia/commute), top commuting hours in Des Moines are between 6:30-8:30am and 4:30-7pm. Because commuting hours fall into peak Citi Bike usage hours, Des Moines would be good city to implement a bike program.  

Lastly, this Tableau story depics gender breakdowns by city. Based on the Citi Bike data, men comprise 65% of citi bike records. Both Des Moines and NYC have similar gender breakdowns - Roughly 48% Male and 51% Female. Based on data from Strave, a popular workout application, women feel more uncomfortable than men when it comes to riding bicycles. This is due to safety concerns within the female population.

## Overall Thoughts

Des Moines would be a great place to start a Citi Bike program, as it shares similar demographics of age and gender breakdowns with NYC. Since NYC has already implemented a successful bike program, it is wise to follow their lead and implement more programs in key metro areas with similar demographics.
