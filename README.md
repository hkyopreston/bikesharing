# NYC Citi Bike Analysis and Gender Distribution

In this project, I am analyzing the population and gender diversity of both Des Moines, Iowa and New York City. My key questions for research were: 

    - What is the population of Des Moines?
    - How does its population compare to the population of New York City?
    - Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
    -What is the gender diversity of Des Moines?
    How does it compare to teh gender diversity of New York City?
    What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?

The first part of my research was to dive into historical Citi Bike Data for New York City. This data gave a baseline as to what investors should be looking for in regards to population density and gender diversity.
